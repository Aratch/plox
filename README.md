# Plox - A lox implementation in Python

This is a (more or less verbatim, and work-in-progress) Java-to-Python translation of the `jlox` interpreter as found in Robert Nystrom's magnificent [book on designing and implementing interpreted languages called "Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

I aim to preserve my learner's journey with this repo, including the commit history (warts and all), as well as some notes in org-mode and, hopefully, as many challenges as possible.
