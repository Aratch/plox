#+title: 08 Statement Grammar

* 8.1 Statements

With our current expression syntax in the back of our head:

#+begin_src bnf
expression -> sequence ;
sequence   -> ternary ( "," ternary )* ;
ternary    -> equality ( "?" expression ":" ternary )* ;
equality   -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison -> term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term       -> factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor     -> unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary      -> ( "!" | "-" ) unary
            | primary ;
primary    -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
            | "(" expression ")" ;
#+end_src

We start with two kinds of statements:

1. *Expression statements*: Let's you place an expression where a statement is expected.
2. =print= *statements*

#+begin_src bnf
program   -> statement* EOF ;

statement -> exprStmt
          | printStmt ;

exprStmt  -> expression ";" ;
printStmt -> "print" expression ";" ;
#+end_src

* 8.2 Variables

#+begin_src bnf
program     -> declaration* EOF ;

declaration -> varDecl
            | statement ;

varDecl     -> "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;

statement   -> exprStmt
            | printStmt ;

exprStmt    -> expression ";" ;
printStmt   -> "print" expression ";" ;

[...]

primary    -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
            | "(" expression ")"
            | IDENTIFIER ;
#+end_src

* 8.4.1 Assignment

#+begin_src bnf
program     -> declaration* EOF ;

declaration -> varDecl
            | statement ;

varDecl     -> "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;

[...]

// Verbatim quote from 8.4.1
expresson   -> assignment ;
assignment  -> IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
            | equality ;
// ^
// |
// -- In this case, assignment has the lowest precedence, as in C
// but this is only the case because we're ignoring the comma sequence operator

// The following is with both ',' sequence and ternary conditional operators in mind
expression  -> sequence ;
sequence    -> assignment ( "," assignment )* ;
assignment  -> IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
            | ternary ;
ternary    -> equality ( "?" expression ":" ternary )* ;
equality   -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
#+end_src

Is this correct? /I have no idea./

Does it make sense that you can chain assignments in this grammar indefinitely?

#+begin_src lox
a = b = c = d
#+end_src

Kind of.

Does it make sense that you can directly chain ternary conditionals within an assignment?

#+begin_src lox
a = b = c > d ? "foo" : "bar"
#+end_src

...why not, actually?

* 8.5.2 Block syntax


#+begin_src bnf
statement -> exprStmt
           | printStmt
           | block ;


block     -> "{" declaration* "}" ;
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
A block is a (possibly) empty series of statements or declarations surrounded by curly braces.
#+end_quote
