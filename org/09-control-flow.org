* 9.2 Conditional Execution

#+begin_src bnf
statement -> exprStmt
             | ifStmt
             | printStmt
             | block ;

ifStmt    -> "if" "(" expression ")" statement
             ( "else" statement )? ;
#+end_src

* 9.3 Logical Operators

Semantic gotcha: Logical =and= and =or= operators *short-circuit*.

#+begin_src bnf
expression -> assignment ;
assignment -> IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
           | logic_or ;

logic_or   -> logic_and ( "or" logic_and )* ;
logic_and  -> equality ( "and" equality )* ;
