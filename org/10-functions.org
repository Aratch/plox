#+title: 10 Functions


* 10.1 Function calls

There's more to function calls than meets the eye.

*Anything* can be a /callee/, as long as it evaluates to a function. As in:

#+begin_src c
getCallback()();
#+end_src

Function calls, being expressions, have to have higher precedence (i.e. lower on the ladder), just below =primary=:

#+begin_src bnf
unary -> ( "!" | "-" ) unary | call ;
call  -> primary ( "(" arguments? ")" )* ;

arguments -> expression ( "," expression )* ;
#+end_src

To paraphrase the book: The =call= rule describes bare primary expressions (i.e. no parentheses after the primary expression) and/or call chains with a call depth of one or more.

* 10.3 Function declarations

The =declaration= rule looked like this previously:

#+begin_src bnf
declaration -> varDecl
            | statement ;
#+end_src

We're adding a new production like so:

#+begin_src bnf
declaration -> funDecl
            |  varDecl
            |  statement ;

funDecl     -> "fun" function ;
function    -> IDENTIFIER "(" parameters? ")" block ;
#+end_src

=parameters= looks deceptively like =arguments=, but =parameters= only has =IDENTIFIER= elements:
#+begin_src bnf
parameters  -> IDENTIFIER ( "," IDENTIFIER )* ;
#+end_src
